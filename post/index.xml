      <description>When first looking at the draft of 2004 it could have been a lot different because of the way that the first pick ended up.
Eli manning was the top Quarterback coming out of Ole Miss but did not want to be drafted number one overall by the San Diego Chargers because the market would not fit a Manning, so there next target was Philip Rivers from North Carolina State at Four.</description>
