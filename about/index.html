    <div class="article-content">
      <p>As a Sports fan I do not intend on making this into something that will make people mad or to bring down a players career by nit picking through there career.</p>
<p>This is just intended to see that with three careers in my generation that are close and honestly to me seem pretty interesting to see who stat wise would be inducted in canton at the Pro Football Hall of fame.</p>
<p>The three quarterbacks I will be discussing are three that can be described as being in the weirdest draft day where two were traded for eachother in Eli Manning and Philip Rivers and then the other cooming from a non power five school but showed that doesn&rsquo;t matter much in Ben Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>As we take this adventure and look throughout their careers I will be refering to them by different names; Rivers for Philip Rivers, Manning for Eli Manning and Big Ben for Ben Roethlisberger hope there is no confusion.</p>
