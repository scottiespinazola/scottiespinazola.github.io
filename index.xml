      <description>Hello again.
Another algorithm, another blog post and a lot of frustrated at basketball moments.
When starting this assignment of predicting and gambling on NBA games we first started out with a very simple model. One that just involved three features; turnover percentage, offensive efficiency and a free throw factor. After dealing with that pile of crap I decided to go back to what makes the most sense to me which is making a very balanced algorithm.</description>

      <description>So the time has finally come. I am excited and nervous.
I feel like I am playing in the tournament but that is far from the truth. I played organized basketball for about three years, I think I scored a handful of baskets. I played before my growth spurt so I think that has a lot to do why I am not playing in college right now and preparing for a long NBA career.</description>

      <description>There is no I in the word team but once or twice or honestly however many you want to say in every generation a player makes you think that maybe it does just come down to one person.
Who comes to mind for me is Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Tom Brady, and you can even put Mike Trout in there for making the angels a pretty solid team.</description>

      <description>As a Sports fan I do not intend on making this into something that will make people mad or to bring down a players career by nit picking through there career.
This is just intended to see that with three careers in my generation that are close and honestly to me seem pretty interesting to see who stat wise would be inducted in canton at the Pro Football Hall of fame.</description>
