      <description>When first looking at the draft of 2004 it could have been a lot different because of the way that the first pick ended up.
Eli manning was the top Quarterback coming out of Ole Miss but did not want to be drafted number one overall by the San Diego Chargers because the market would not fit a Manning, so there next target was Philip Rivers from North Carolina State at Four.</description>

      <description>As a Sports fan I do not intend on making this into something that will make people mad or to bring down a players career by nit picking through there career.
This is just intended to see that with three careers in my generation that are close and honestly to me seem pretty interesting to see who stat wise would be inducted in canton at the Pro Football Hall of fame.</description>
