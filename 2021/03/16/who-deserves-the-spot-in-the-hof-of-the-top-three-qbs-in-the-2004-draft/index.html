<p>As a Sports fan I do not intend on making this into something that will make people mad or to bring down a players career by nit picking through there career.</p>
<p>This is just intended to see that with three careers in my generation that are close and honestly to me seem pretty interesting to see who stat wise would be inducted in canton at the Pro Football Hall of fame.</p>
<p>The three quarterbacks I will be discussing are three that can be described as being in the weirdest draft day where two were traded for eachother in Eli Manning and Philip Rivers and then the other cooming from a non power five school but showed that doesn’t matter much in Ben Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>As we take this adventure and look throughout their careers I will be refering to them by different names; Rivers for Philip Rivers, Manning for Eli Manning and Big Ben for Ben Roethlisberger hope there is no confusion.</p>
<p>When first looking at the draft of 2004 it could have been a lot different because of the way that the first pick ended up.</p>
<p>Eli manning was the top Quarterback coming out of Ole Miss but did not want to be drafted number one overall by the San Diego Chargers because the market would not fit a Manning, so there next target was Philip Rivers from North Carolina State at Four. That landed Eli with the New York Giants and Rivers to the Chargers.</p>
<p>That is all of the drama that was going on in the top ten of the draft but right outside of the that was 11th overall pick Big Ben Roethlisberger from Miami of Ohio.</p>
<p>So now they have their destinations and the routes that they took and the only one that changed teams since the draft drama and after was Rivers when he went to the Colts, playoff run but not past the first round.</p>
<p>The three of them when looking at the stats and just being able to watch them live when I was able to it is pretty clear that the three are not know for being the most mobile quarterbacks; but hey all 18 Pro Bowls and four Super Bowl rings make up this group.</p>

<p>But what we will be looking at first is the passing yards and the running yards for these three careers.</p>
<p>Side note obviously I know that Big Ben is stll playing and will probably over take some of the arguments, if he can put up numbers he did a season ago, but we are going to save that for when he does retire and just focus on the stats he has now.</p>

<p>Seeing what the yards have to say it really is seen then they are not mobile but yet the just showing that with what all three have accomplished in their careers has been done with that missile they call an arm.</p>

<p>Rivers takes the yardage test but not by much, I would say that this came at a surprise but not because of Rivers. Eli comes in at last, which surprised me, maybe the Manning name, but what he has done with his career is something that I guess doesn’t show up on his stats.</p>
<p>Rivers tops both because of what he has done with his side arm type passes, Big Ben does take the crown for the rushing yards but that is because of his x-factor being escape artist (for the Madden fans).</p>
<p>All of these stats do make sense though when you take them into consideration, the teams that all three played for always had those quick little running backs that could take the screens or dumpdowns that some mobile quarterbacks would take for themselves.</p>
<p>Chargers have had Austin Ekeler, Steelers Le’von Bell and the Giants with Saquon Barkley, Amid Bradshaw,and Teke Barbor. Helping pad those passing stats make sense of the crazy lopsided story being told in the chart above but also it shows the story is that Rivers did more with his completetions than Big Ben or Eli.</p>
<p>Yards can be dinks and dunks from screens or under arms passes as we see from Mahomes but Touchdowns and Int do come from good passes and smart/dumb descision making. Or you could be Jamis Winston and be throwing the 30 touchdowns in a season, lead the league in passing but also lead the league in interceptions by a landslide. But with us and these players we are not going to be talking about players that make head shaking mistakes.</p>

<p>We are going to be talking about the ratio between touchdowns and interceptions because truly when looking at this stat ou are giving your team points or costing your team the game so this will show when the time comes who came up for their team.</p>

<pre><code>## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)</code></pre>
<p>When throwing a touchdown touch, precision, and smart decision making are all what comes to mind but it all is the opposite when it comes to interceptions. You would think the with the year the Steelers just had with their undefeated stretch that Big Ben would be able to bring in the title for this ratio but it may have been that loss in the playoffs that made this what it is.</p>

<p>Rivers takes this ratio by close to thirty which is interesting but as to what Big Ben could have done was made his ratio a little more impressive by not throwing those interceptions in a playoff game that was just a tad embarrassing.</p>
<p>Rivvers has passing yards and now touchdowns, Big Ben does take the title though for less mistakes but what is more interesting in this chart is the fact that Eli is last again…. but this time by a lot has close to 50 more intereceptions than Big ben and around 30 less touchdowns as well. Eli had a great career don’t get me wrong here but was it just the rings that make him in this coversation? it is looking that way.</p>
<p>Obviously Super Bowl rings are impressive but let me ask you this… If Rivers had just one ring would that push him into the clear spot taker? Now Rivers has better career yards, more touchdowns, only a few more interceptions yet gets all of the slander when put up against his fellow draft mates.</p>
<p>Rings and playoffs are important so lets take a look why don’t we since we are already here.</p>

<p>This little data sheet is something that I put together to get a look at some of the aspects that go into conversations with friends when discussing g.o.a.t’s or quarterbacks in general and so why not bring it into this conversaton. We will be looking at Games, Wins, Passing Yards, Int, Td, Rings, and then some little interest factor we got Pro Bowls.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>playoffstats &lt;- read_csv(&quot;Playoffs.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   Player = col_character(),
##   Games = col_double(),
##   Wins = col_double(),
##   PassingYards = col_double(),
##   Int = col_double(),
##   Td = col_double(),
##   Rings = col_double(),
##   ProBowls = col_double()
## )</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>playoffcat &lt;- playoffstats %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(Games)) </code></pre>
<p>So then lets get this straight when it comes to playoffs as it looks Big Ben has the experience with ten more games, the same amount of wins as the two have combine, that previous statement works the same for the touchdowns and rings. But Rivers takes down Eli again with yards and both in Pro Bowls.</p>

<p>What I am getting from this is that Big Ben takes the spot with playoffs and Rivers takes it with regular season. I hate to say it but post season matters, if someone tells you that it doesn’t then they might be a Andy Dalton or Matthew Stafford fan.</p>
<p>But when wrapping this thing in a pretty little bow that it deserves would be this, the question was asked “Who would take the spot in canton if there was only one spot left?” and I hate to say it because I was pulling for Rivers but it was said before Big Ben Roethlisberger gets the spot. Here is why he comes in close second in all of the above categories of the regular season and is still going to be playing and STARTING so those will be taken over but it really comes from Roethlisbergers experience and success in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Rings matter Rivers should back up Mahomes for a couples heres and maybe next time we do this type of thing he can be the choosen one but not this time, after all side arms are not going to win championships and you cann quote me here.</p>
<p>Atleast neither of Rivers or Roethlsberger lost their job to Danny Dimes.</p>
